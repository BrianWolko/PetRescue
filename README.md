## About 

PetRescue is our proposed solution to give support and connect people who wish to adopt/rescue a pet in the streets with people who can facilitate and help in this process. 

By the latter group we mean all those individuals or communities that :

- Have information about the location or condition of a street animal. 
- Are part of a animal refuge or volunteer program and can share their insights and experience. 
- Can offer a ride as a driver who volunteers for transportation.  <--- mejorar este
- Have veterinary knowledge or experience.   
- Just wnat to plain help
- And others that can be added later!
