# About 

PetRescue is our proposed solution to give support and connect people who wish to adopt/rescue a pet in the streets with people who can facilitate and help in this process. 

By the latter group we mean all those individuals or communities that :

- Have information about the location or condition of a stray animal. 
- Are part of a animal refuge or volunteer program and can share their insights and experience. 
- Can help with transportation and or can volunteer to offer a ride. 
- Have veterinary knowledge or experience.   
- Just want to help the community.

<br>

# Why
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Alvaro-Orellana/PetRescue/blob/master/images%20for%20readme/historias_screen.gif" width="315" height="560">  

Animal shelters despite their best efforts are constantly struggling with overcrowding and incapacity to find owners for all of their pets; this is due to their heavy dependence on volunteer work and reliance on old methods of notice/advertisement. These old methods include: newspapers, local radio and television stations, photos posted in stores and animal hospitals, etc.

To tackle these main deterrents of shelters' progress we developed an app that improves on the means of public announcement and simplifies the cumbersome rescuing/adoption process.

We identified the mayor inconveniences and the most difficult processes to coordinate to be the following:

- Search and location of animals that best suit the criteria of what a potential adopter is looking for
- The reception and communication between the parties involved in the adoption process (rescuers and adopters)
- Assisting rescuers through contact with shelters, volunteers and veterinarians
- Transportation
- Medical attention

<br>
We expect that a proper solution of these issues will greatly increase the probability of adoption.

# How it works

The app is divided into three main screens. These screens are Search, Stories and Profile. Within these the user navigates through the app and can publish, browse, comment, localize pets and interact with other users. 

<br>

## Search screen 
This is for discovering and posting about the location and condition of stray animals. It consists of a map and a scrolling list of images. Each image has an associated location that is automatically shown on the map when it is scrolled to. Also a detail screen appears when the user taps on an image.

## Stories screen 
Presents different categories for browsing and posting content. Each category is related to the main concerns (according to our research) of the whole rescue/adoption process.
These are: "Search for a Family", "Search for a Driver", "Advice".

Tapping on any of these will display a list of posts relating to it's category, similar to the way social networks present content. Each post can also have comments.

## Profile Screen
This is just your standard profile screen that shows the information of the registered user and allows editing. Also you can see the content that you posted.

# Uploading content

Here's a quick demo of how it looks to upload or edit content in every screen. In each case the user has to tap a button on the same location, the upper right corner. This was made for consistency and easier user experience.

# To do

Posible features that could be added in future versions:

- Enable users to upload not just images but also videos
- More categories in Stories screen. Can be easily added if there's demand for it.
- On the Search screen map show also the location of nearby adoption homes.
- Direct messaging with the author of a post
