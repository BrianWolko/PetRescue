# About 

PetRescue is our proposed solution to give support and connect people who wish to adopt/rescue a pet in the streets with people who can facilitate and help in this process. 

By the latter group we mean all those individuals or communities that :

- Have information about the location or condition of a stray animal. 
- Are part of a animal refuge or volunteer program and can share their insights and experience. 
- Can help with transportation and or can volunteer to offer a ride. 
- Have veterinary knowledge or experience.   
- Just want to help the community.

# Why
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/Alvaro-Orellana/PetRescue/blob/master/images%20for%20readme/historias_screen.gif" width="315" height="560">  

Animal shelters despite their best efforts are constantly struggling with overcrowding and incapacity to find owners to all of their pets. There's just no room for all of them. This is due to their heavilly dependence on volunteer work and reliance on old methods of notice/advertisement. These old methods include: newspapers, local radio and television stations, and photos posted in stores, animal hospitals, etc.

The best way people can help their local shelters is not with more money or more capacity but to increase adoptions. To achieve this we developed an app that 
improves the methods for public notice and simplifies the cumbersome rescuing/adoption process.

We identified the mayor inconveniences and the most difficult processes to coordinate to be the following:

- The reception and communication between the parties involved in the adoption process (rescuers and adopters).
- Search and location of animals that best suit the criteria of what a potential adopter is looking for.
- Assisting rescuers through contact with shelters and volunteers.

We believe that providing a solution to all of these problems our app can grow a foster care community, giving support to those who do thus strengthening the community and increase the probability of adoption.

# How it works

The application allows you to publish, search, comment and meet the different rescuers and people who want to adopt. It also allows you to upload the location to find yourself between the rescuer and the adopter. In addition, it allows you to search and offer yourself as a driver for transfers and to publish and answer different queries.

The application adapts to the needs of each user in terms of everything that concerns adoption, be it a rescuer or someone who wants to adopt.

"Stories" will have an interface similar to Facebook where posts made by users will be displayed, divided into categories specifically related to the rescue and adoption of an animal in the street. Initially, they will appear: "Search for a Family", "Search for a Driver", "Advice". These are the initials but the system will be designed in such a way that more categories can be added in the future if necessary.

The user within this screen will be able to navigate, publish, delete stories; and start a conversation by chatting with the author of the posts.

A story will consist of text plus images, and potentially videos.

When selecting a story the user will be taken to a new screen showing only the selected story and the option to send messages to the author will be displayed.

"Search" consists of a map with the current position of the user that will show markers with the location of nearby adoption homes.

"Profile" will show the information of the registered user, mainly name, surname, photo, and contact.

It will allow you to edit the entered data, upload a user photo and exit the account.
